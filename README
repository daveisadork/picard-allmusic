AllMusic Genres is a plugin for MusicBrainz Picard that scrapes genre, style
and potentially other information from allmusic.com

In case you downloaded it from somewhere else, you can always get the latest
version of this plugin from http://github.com/daveisadork/picard-allmusic

At this point, this plugin requires the following libraries:

 * difflib
 
 * urllib
 
 * urllib2
 
 * BeautifulSoup 
   http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup

Basically, if you're running Picard on anything other than Linux, it's probably
not going to work. If you are running Linux, you probably only need to install
the python-beautifulsoup package provided by your distribution.

Once you have all the libraries you need, just drop allmusic.py into your 
plugins directory (which is ~/.config/MusicBrainz/Picard/plugins on my system)
and enable it via the 'Options' menu in Picard.

There are no configuration options yet, so you're kind of just stuck with 
whatever the plugin happens to find. Basically, assuming we can find a page for
whatever album we're trying to tag, we just grab all of the "styles" listed on
that page and tell Picard to use them as genre tags.
